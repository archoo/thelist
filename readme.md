## **The List**

update: March 2024
  i realised that the previous description was fundamentally wrong considering the amount of unnecessary crap i had in this project..
  life is much easier when you dont have a package manager, or bundler, or anything really.. 
  just plain html/css/js .. 

probably the simplest task list interface ever developed

captures keyboard while tab is active
uses local storage
